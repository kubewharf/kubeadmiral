        description: ClusterPropagatedVersion holds version information about the
          state propagated from KubeFed APIs (configured by FederatedTypeConfig resources)
          to member clusters. The name of a ClusterPropagatedVersion encodes the kind
          and name of the resource it stores information for (i.e. <lower-case kind>-<resource
          name>). If a target resource has a populated metadata.Generation field,
          the generation will be stored with a prefix of `gen:` as the version for
          the cluster.  If metadata.Generation is not available, metadata.ResourceVersion
          will be stored with a prefix of `rv:` as the version for the cluster.
