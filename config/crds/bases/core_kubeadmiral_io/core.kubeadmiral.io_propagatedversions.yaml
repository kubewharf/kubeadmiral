          description: PropagatedVersion holds version information about the state propagated from FederatedObject to member clusters. The name of a PropagatedVersion is the same as its FederatedObject. If a target resource has a populated metadata.Generation field, the generation will be stored with a prefix of `gen:` as the version for the cluster.  If metadata.Generation is not available, metadata.ResourceVersion will be stored with a prefix of `rv:` as the version for the cluster.
